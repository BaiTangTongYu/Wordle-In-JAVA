# **Wordle In JAVA**
This is a Java version of the game wordle that I created in my JAVA class!

## Instructions

 Run the file WordleGame through CMD, enter the word after entering the game, the player can click to check the word is correct or not, or click again to restart the game.

Here is the code to start the game

```java
java WordelGame
```

## Rule

The goal is to guess the five letter word in six tries.（Only lowercase letters can be entered）

Red - the letter is not in the word.

Yellow - the letter is in the word but not in the right spot.

Green - the letter is in the right spot.
